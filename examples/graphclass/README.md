## Task Definition

**Graph Classification** is a Graph Learning task that operates at the graph level, requiring models to learn representations that capture both local connectivity patterns and global topological characteristics across diverse graph structures. Unlike node-level tasks that predict properties of individual nodes, graph classification assigns labels to entire graphs based on their overall structural and semantic properties.

### Key Characteristics

- **Input**: Complete graphs with node features, edges, and optional edge attributes
- **Output**: Class labels for entire graphs (binary or multi-class)
- **Challenge**: Learning graph-level representations that capture both local patterns and global topology
- **Evaluation**: Typically uses 10-fold cross-validation with accuracy as the primary metric

## Applications

Graph classification has diverse real-world applications across multiple domains:

1. **Molecular Property Prediction**: Drug discovery and toxicity assessment of chemical compounds
2. **Social Network Analysis**: Community detection and user behavior modeling
3. **Protein Function Prediction**: Bioinformatics and structural biology applications
4. **Fraud Detection**: Financial transaction networks and payment systems
5. **Recommendation Systems**: Social graphs and user interaction networks
6. **Malware Detection**: Program call graphs and behavioral analysis
7. **Material Property Prediction**: Chemistry and materials science applications
8. **Biological Network Analysis**: Disease pathway identification and biomarker discovery
